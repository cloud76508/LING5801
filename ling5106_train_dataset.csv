Class,Star,Review
1,1,"Over $7.00 for a small container of mediocre chicken noodle soup! Their website claims they have the best chicken noodle soup, but I beg to differ. We threw half of it out. I did carryout before the crowds came in. I won't make that mistake of going there again."
1,1,"Went to this restaurant before heading back home. Got seated right away and told the waitress that we were in a bit of a time crunch so we could make our bus. She said the food would take 25 minutes so we agreed it would be alright. 

Ordered shortly after and waited about 45 minutes. Checked in about 35 minutes in with another waiter on the status of our meal and he replied with ""Uhhhh I actually don't know. Let me get your waiter."" He didn't get our waiter, no one followed up with us, so we decided to leave.

As we walked out the door, we noticed our waitress saw us and ran over to the hostess. The hostess then started yelling at us that we needed to pay and wouldn't let my brother leave the building. She rudely asked him ""What do you think you're doing?"" and he told her we never got out food. She then said ""Well why didn't you say that before?""

Well guess what, we couldn't say anything to you or your staff because 1. Our waitress never came back to our table and 2. You right off the bat accused us of dining and dashing. 

Great end to our trip. Oh wait, IT WAS TERRIBLE."
1,1,"So today I went to Annie's parlour and I honestly wanted 5 guys but,I decided to try something different and I was disappointed! I got a cheese burger and a side of fries and my friend got a mushroom burger. The service was really bad and the server was rude. We asked for a refill and she seemed so annoyed like how dare you ask for a refill type of attitude. The burgers tasted bland and heavy literally no flavor and the fries were okay! We ate everything because we were hungry and we forgot to tip the waitress and thankfully we did because of the bad service! Only time I would go back is to try the shakes.... IF I EVER go back"
1,1,"I liked the atmosphere here, but that is it seriously. Bad service, bad food. Their burger was so overcooked and dry. not even fresh at all. But gotta say they have decent malts and large portion. Three and a half star is too much for this place. Very disappointed! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
1,1,"Stopped in for late lunch before a show at the varsity. If I had to describe the experience in one word it would be ""awkward."" The staff seemed preoccupied and uninterested and the food was pretty bland and sloppy. The atmosphere was cold and quietI ordered the Riverside which was basically supposed to be an open faced burger with gravy, mushrooms, sautéed onions and fries. The portion was so large that it overflowed the plate. Burger, onions, and mushrooms were undercooked, the bread was mush, and the fries were over seasoned. The gravy was fortunately bland enough to mask the fry seasoning. I'd compare the meal to a 1970's TV dinner. The others guests burgers looked good, but my meal was far from that."
1,1,"Came here for malts at 10. Man, they were terrible. The malt I asked for had none of the gusto! No Oreos, no coffee, basically vanilla malt. Full of warm foam.

My previous experience here was disappointing in the malt department as well."
1,1,"A. Dirty!  B. You can do the greasy food served by uncaring staff thing well, but I'm not quite sure they pull it off. C.  Seemingly unfriendly, largely bored, incompetent staff who seem inconvenienced whenever asked for anything. 
There are better choices in the area for a ""Dinkytown"" experience.
But, if you're a starving college student, enjoy! It's a little better than dorm food."
1,1,"I actually went to this palce expecting that the food would be passe, because they are known for their Malts and I didnt think tht they would put much effort in the food. I was right.
As long as this place doesn't try to pass itself off as a place were you will get good food and good service then it wil be ok, but if it tries to be anything other than aplace were drunk colledge kids go or people who just want to get a bite to eat before partying then it is not a good resteraunt. So in Short the food was terrible but the Malts were good."
1,1,"The place looks run down, in general, quality seems ignored. The only reason to come here is for nostalgia. Order food at your risk. The fries had no potato flavor, only grease- old grease. The California burger was bland. The small tomatoe tasted like card board. The ketchup is a substandard knock-off with an overly sugary taste My friend's malt seemed satisfactory though nothing special. I take the ""Kemps"" tub in the cleaning area as an idication that they use plain jane ice cream available in supermarkets everywhere. Our waitress was meek and kind, I spared her from my dim views."
1,2,"First time at Annie's. we will not be returning. Seated quickly, and malts came fast, then we waited 45 minutes for a couple burgers and corn dogs. Waitress was annoyed by our complaint that Hour wait for food was excessive and one burger was not what we ordered. Hostess was nice. Waitress never returned to our table once we complained. Food was NOT GOOD either. We try to support local businesses, but we should've gone to Applebee's."
1,2,"Came here with friends after a dance practice and was extremely hungry. Was sat before a group of 10 people, received my order AFTER said group. Received my burger after an HOUR of waiting, cheese was cold and fries were stale. Turns out our server mistakenly put their tickets in before ours. Horrible. The only reason why I didn't leave sooner was because my friends were there with me. After reading other reviews, it's not uncommon that others find the staff incompetent and rude. Awful service. Overpriced food. Not worth it. The next time I want burgers and malt I'll take my business to Snuffy's in St. Paul."
1,2,"Love Annie's patio in the summertime! Food is subpar but the patio makes eating here worth it. Last visit, however, we were sat in a booth with NAILS STICKING OUT OF IT. seriously? Also, everything took so long to come out. And our water was never refilled. Waiters need to be more on top of things."
1,2,"We were in town for a tour of the university. The tour guide raved about the place so we thought we'd give it a try.
Gave it two stars because of the malt/shake... It was delicious. As other posted listed, it's really not a malt which I was expecting, but as a shake it was very flavorful.
The burgers were big and tasty. Found a hair in the second half of my burger. When I informed the server ( obviously not too experienced), she actually said ""that does happen sometimes""... She offered a new burger or something else on the menu. I asked her to just take it off my bill. She said she couldn't do that but she could bring something else. I then simply asked for the manager. The manger came within 5 minutes, he asked ""what can I do for you"", so I then asked him if the server informed him of the problem. He said yes and offered something else from the menu. I asked to take it off the bill. He said yes. I think he could have offered more but I just didn't feel like pressing the issue.
The fries came Ina huge basket which was exciting, until we ate them... Very very mediocre, and not worth the two pounds they gave us. I will say, the onion rings were absolutely fabulous!
If we're in town again, we'll pass on this place and something else interesting."
1,2,"this place used to have better burgers.
portion sizes for sides are huge, but burgers have been smaller, dry and bland lately. 
Really just a basic place for college students with a large appetite and a few extra bucks. 
if i go back, it would just be for the massive fry basket and a shared milkshake"
1,2,"Positives include great shakes and the chicken tenders kids meal came out perfect, fresh and hot straight from the kitchen.

Negatives are the slowest service I've ever experienced anywhere and the balance of the burgers, fries and onion rings were not hot. They seemed overwhelmed and understaffed with a light Monday lunch crowd. 

The burgers had no seasoning or distinctive flavor. Overall a big letdown, there are much better burgers out there including Five Guys."
1,2,"For somewhere that's supposed to be a Dinkytown institution, this place is a little lackluster.

Some things I do enjoy. For instance, sitting out on their patio on a nice warm day is a lot of fun. Great people watching, for sure. The milkshakes are also really great when you want to ""treat your self"" (Parks and Rec, anyone?). You can definitely split one between two people, unless you really like ice cream.

But, the burgers and fries? Blah. Honestly, you can get a better burger in Dinkytown at Five Guys, and I don't even like Five Guys that much. The fries are crispy and good, as they should be at a diner, but the burgers taste like they came from my high school cafeteria. They have a burger with sour cream on it (I can't find their menu online... they don't have a website?) that is good but I think that's because I have a weird thing for sour cream. The service is fine but nothing awesome as it is generally college students.

I'd recommend going here for a milkshake on the patio, but nothing else. If they upped their food game I'd definitely make this a regular spot to meet up with friends."
1,2,"If you're looking for a superb malt or shake, this is the place! But if you want a fabulous burger - no, not here. The beef is way overdone and at best it comes slathered in toppings that mask the gray meat. The bun is totally ordinary. The fries are interesting -- not bad if you like them fried hard and relatively crunchy. But again, I've had better. Yeah, even at...gulp...Wendys. Annie's  has NO jalapenos. No brown mustard. And lots of high volume kids. Great for kids. Good for very tolerant students and parents because the kids seem to have fun running all over the place. The prices are moderate. I don't mind paying $6 for a great burger, but really students...this is not it. Go for the malts. And the wait staff are good natured helpful and responsive - they get 5 stars."
1,2,"it's been awhile since i've written a bad review, and i've been looking forward to sinking my teeth in writing this one.

this place is terrible.  if you're cool enough to be a hipster under 22 you'll probably like it... but if you've had any kind of life experience at all, you'll hate it.  i've had better burgers and fries in the hospital cafeteria.  even mcdonald's has better burgers and fries.  the patties are limp, flat and flavorless.  the bread is stale.  average fries.    

the biggest tragedy is that they're not even that cheap!    $5.25 for a bottle of beer...not even draft."
1,2,Use to go here all the time when I lived in Dinkytown.... something happened to their malts.. It seems like they went to the custardy stuff like from Culver's.  I was a bit bummed.  Took a couple of bites and tossed it away.
1,2,"I understand this is a U of M staple and I will say their shakes are delicious. 

But everything else is meh. The burgers are like cardboard, and I've tried some of their other sandwiches and they're either really greasy or just gross. They give you a large portion of fries (it's extra) but they always seem to come from the bottom of the bag so they're just pieces and those are super greasy too.  But it is a good place to bring a group of people."
1,2,Burgers are NOT that great. This place is way over-hyped. The atmosphere is fun and the malts and fries are good. But the burgers are pretty lame IMHO.
1,2,"The burgers here are too greasy/bland and the fries are over seasoned with Cajun salt. I got the bunless burger with grilled mushrooms/onions and when I finished, felt like I had just eaten a stick of butter. I do appreciate that they offer low carb alternatives and are not annoyed when you ask for a bunless burger."
1,2,"After driving by Five Guys since it opened we decided to try it lfor the first time last night. is it unAmerican to complain about the portions being too large? They are. We threw away about a third of the meal, not knowing there would be so many fries in a size small or that the burger had two patties. The burger had no flavor, the cheese was clearly processed and not even melted-- part of the slice was actually cold. I was excited to order mushrooms, but they seemed to be canned:slimy, flavorless, and also cold. All in all a very boring burger. The fries were not noteworthy in any way I see no compelling reason to eat at Five Guys."
1,2,"Takes 10+ minutes to get a burger on a slow day. Music is way to loud. Regular size sodas are around $2.50. The toppings are great, but the bun/burger isn't much better than you'd get at McDonalds. Lots of fries, but the quality is very mixed. Their branding about being the ""best"" burger is totally bullshit: they're about quantity, not quality. Feel like shit after."
1,2,"The burgers here just do not stay together for longer than maybe three bites. The bun doesn't hold together very well, so all the toppings end up on the table. However, it is quite tasty, just very messy and structurally unsound. And I must say - before this, I didn't even realize that burger stability had such a big impact on enjoyment of a burger. If I wanted a patty and a side salad, I wouldn't have gone to a burger place? 

Five Guys has burgers at comparable prices to Annie's Parlor, which is two blocks away. The buns and actual patty at Annie's is much better, BUT Five Guys has much nicer (and free!) toppings. So YMMV."
1,2,"Their french fries are ridiculously greasy and still have the peels on.  Also, they have no ice cream and are expensive."
1,2,"Five Guys, Five Guys, Five Guys, shame on you. 

You force me to subject the Yelpiverse to a rant about hamburger buns. Well, so be it. 

A few years ago, I remember hearing the name Five Guys for the first time. I was just a naive California girl back then, whose gourmet fast food horizons were pretty much limited to In-n-Out. I was excited, although a bit scared that my world was about to be blown. 

Fast forward a few years, I am now a slightly more cynical upper Midwest transplant. I was drunk and wearing a Halloween costume in Madison, WI. I saw the safe glow of Five Guys and a bevvy of equally drunk young people in queue. I thought, ""I am now ready to have my mind blown."" The amount of free toppings meant that the artist had a blank canvas for truly drunken greasy masterpiece. Admittedly, I think I went a little overboard.

Instead, all I found was disappointment. 

I believe the ""bread"" part of anything provides a foundation to the food. Without a strong foundation, a house cannot stand. Without a proper bun, a Hamburger cannot stand. By the end of my little cheese burger, I was reduced to juggling the remnants of a good hamburger, the bun had completely wasted away to a soggy paste. I was totally unimpressed. 

I gave Five Guys another chance. I recently made a trip with my boyfriend. We totally got aww'd when we made our order. Boyfriend: ""I'll have a bacon cheeseburger."" Me: And I will have the little bacon cheeseburger."" (yeah, we're cute.) I was hopeful this time. I decided to go easy on the free toppings, perhaps that was the reason for my total hamburger bun meltdown last time. I went easy with some tomato, lettuce, grilled onions and mustard. I even asked if I could have my bun toasted. The girl at the front told me that they do toast their buns. (Woulda fooled me) 

When our food came, my burger looked promising, but by the end, I was still left trying to keep my burger together between the mediocre bun that literally dissolved into a paste. Ugh. Not a fan. The burgers and ingredients are truly good, but they could easily add 2 more stars in my book if they just had a decent bun to hold all the toppings, copiously sized meat patties and cheese. Also, wrapping the entire thing in foil does not help the cause. A soggy nightmare."
1,2,"First, a disclaimer...I did not actually order a burger here...but I ordered fries and a grilled cheese, and tried a bite of a friend's burger.  So, I think I am still qualified to write this review.

Second, as my Yelp motto says, I wholeheartedly support the statement that ""the best things in life are fried""....But after my Five Guys experience, I'm thinking about adding ""as long as they are not also dripping with grease"".  

I got takeout, and ten minutes later when I arrived at my destination, my paper bag of Five Guys goodies was literally dripping through the bag onto the floor with grease.  Now, I must say that everything did taste pretty good, but my friends also called me ""Greasebag"" for the rest of the night.  The grilled cheese was a little soggy, but the fries were pretty delicious.  

I should also mention that I felt pretty horrible afterwards, due to diet-breaking, and the enormously heavy weight in my stomach after eating such a meal.

So, if you need to go on a bender, and soak your sorrows with grease, go here.  The food will taste pretty damn good, but you might not feel that much better afterwards."
1,2,"I've been to both the locations in Edina and now Dinkytown, both are the same and by that I mean the burgers are meh.

It's nice that you can load up on toppings but somehow that ends up only adding more grease and making it more of a challenge to eat. And don't be surprised if you feel like you are having a heart attack afterwards, that's normal. 

The only thing I would go back there for are the Cajun Fries. The grease from the fries makes the bag a slopping slime bally mess within minutes but if you can get past that factor you'll find that the spices gives the fries a good kick. And the $3 regular size could be a meal by itself"
1,2,"I didn't like this place. It's SUPER loud so you can't even think if you're alone or have a conversation if you're with a friend. The music is blaring. It took forever to get my food, and when I did, it was an overly greasy burger wrapped in tinfoil. It's about the quality of a Burger King item, too. This place is nasty."
1,2,"Man, I'm not really feeling this place. After two visits eating a burger with everything on it, I just can't recommend this place. Overcooked meat, kind of blah toppings, overly greasy bread - it's just not for me. However, the service there is very friendly and the fries are okay.

There are so many excellent burger places in the Twin Cities around the same price. I can't justify returning to Five Guys"
1,1,"I'm one starring you guys until you get some halfway passable fries, every time I want to stop in to get an impossible burger I just remember how bland and cheap the fries are here, it's the only weak link of this restaurant, but at burger & fries joint that's a HUGE weak link to have. Management if you go the five guys route and get real potato cut fries instead of the cheap bland generic frozen fry shaped potato products and I will happily bump this review up to five stars."
1,1,I usually always order from my my burger first time I made a pick up order and to start off I order my food pick it up then my burgers was rawww I called immediately after I seen that I mean my kids could of got sick there first off was no manager on duty so I explained how I wanted to bring burgers back they said no I hav to wait on manager they then never called me back preety shady then I had to call back after I got off work the very next day cud FYI they never called me I explained to the manger what happen he said yes I know i could send you a coupon in the mail the. I ask to replace my order he then lied and said I never came in and that I'm trying to steal food and that people steal food 3 times a week there what kinda lie how can people steal food he start yelling on the top of he's lungs saying I was lieing I was there how could I know there was no manager on site and on top of that offer to bring the food back wow don't waste your time on this place give your money to a better place they could get you sick giving you raw hamburgers and then they will be mad about it !!!!!!!!!!!!' Sick people
1,1,"I'm always in search of a great place to get an excellent burger. A couple days ago I thought I would give My Burger a try! It had great reviews and it was close to where I lived.

I went inside and was greeted but since I had never been there before I needed a moment to look over the menu. I guess since I wasn't immediately ready to order, the host at the POS terminal, the cash register became annoyed and went into the dining room to check the trash completely ignoring me or the visual cues that indicated I was ready to order. When I was ready the greater was nowhere to be found as he was in the back part of the dining room this caused me to have to wait and ditional time but I did finally place my order which I ordered a burger and onion rings. They gave me a number and I went and found a table. My burger arrived in a small basket with onion rings on one side and the burger on the other. The burger tasted pretty good but it was not very large in size and the onion rings were burnt to a crisp I could not even eat them. I believe that they had been cooked in the deep fat fryer double the amount of time that was necessary. I am including a picture to see how bad the onion rings looked. I left hungry because I couldn't eat the onion rings and the burger was so small I will say that the burger itself tasted good."
1,1,"Went here today with expectations of a good burger, especially considering all of the good reviews here on yelp. Unfortunately I was not impressed one bit. The service and atmosphere were fine, nothing super special. The burger is what really got me, the meat was bland, and very spongy-like. It reminded me of a Wendy's burger, or a cafeteria burger, or one of those burgers you get in a box from the frozen section at the grocery store. I am a hard-core burger fan, and I know a good burger when I taste one, but I had trouble even finishing my burger here it was so distasteful. I felt sick to my stomach for a bit afterwards just the fact that I ate such a low-quality burger. I would've rather had mcdonalds for much cheaper. My fries were ok, but I could taste a slight fish-flavor in them, which verifies that they do not use separate fryers for different product-yuck! I will stick to my smashburgers next time, as I find Smashburger and burger jones to be much tastier than my burger."
1,2,"I've been to this my burger many times and usually I am very pleased. Today I went in around 6 and ordered burgers to go. A fair amount of customers but not packed. Service was good, didn't wait too long to get my food and I left. When I got home and we started to eat, our burgers were very undercooked. We fired up the grill and had to cook them for a bit. Fries were good and shake was good. This experience kind of turned me off of my burger to be honest..."
1,2,"I'm sure the My Burger fans won't agree with this review but I was really disappointed.  I have driven by My Burger a zillion times and I love burgers so one day recently I decided to treat myself to a My Burger.  The place is super clean and the colors and decorating style, very appealing.  The atmosphere is really cool and it's a desirable place to hang out with a friend, your computer, a magazine or your phone.

I got a California burger and fries.  I bit into the burger and thought..""oh... nothing to write home about and I thought the same about the fries.  I was not impressed.  The food reminded me a lot of Wendy's. I have nothing against Wendy's, I just was expecting MORE of a surge of hamburger delight!

Now I love Five Guys and I REALLY love Matt's Juicy Lucy, so maybe I was setting my sights too high but honestly, I didn't think I would go back.  Friends of mine seem to like it, maybe it's a palate thing but I wasn't in over-the-moon-eyes-rolled-back-into-my-head-hamburger-heaven. That's kind of my criteria...I like to bite into a burger and say, ""OMG!  This is SOOOO good!""  For instance, at Barker's in Hudson, Wi., every time I go there with a girlfriend, we bite into our burgers and both go ""MMMMMMMMMM"" and our mutual eye contact at that moment shows taste-bud bliss is happening!  I like a burger that requires a napkin swipe or two after each bite."
1,2,"I initially gave this place 5-stars. The last few visits have been atrocious.

Criticisms:
* You could need more training on the shake machine--the last malt I had was barely stirred with a spoon. CHUNKS of malt. GROSS.

* Consistency of burgers? Meh. Did you lose all your good cooks? Everything is either under or overcooked now. My patty today was great, but the bun was stale--ugh.

* I don't want your promotional materials shoved in with my order number, I just recycle them anyway.

Praise:
* The place is usually clean.

* The staff is friendly, even if unskilled or inept."
1,2,"I WISH I could give this place five stars. The atmosphere was punchy and colorful and the service was some of the friendliest and most attentive I've EVER experienced. But the burgers are just average and the fries are just plain bad. The chocolate malt was tasty enough, but not a reason to go back"
1,2,"I went there with a hangover because a burger and fries always makes me feel better.  Not this time. The fries were slightly above average, but the burger was bland. I only had two or three little bites and threw the rest away.  Probably won't go back."
1,2,Burger and Onion Rings toooooo salty for me. Staff was very friendly.
1,2,I went here with three of my friends and the food and initial experience was good but once we left we all were feeling really sick! Completely ruined our Saturday night. If you choose to eat here..proceed with caution.
1,2,Go to Richfield location for much better food. This location is not worth the price. Food was lazily put together and fries were over cooked. Thought my burger was a terrible burger place until I went to Richfield location
1,1,"Went to Matt's today for the first time in years. For many years it has always been a never let you down Minneapolis staple. They would always make the fries consistently crunchy and better than McDonald's every time. They changed everything. Undercooked fries, smaller burger, less cheese and a new bun much bigger than the burger. Sorry Matt's, gotta find a new go to place for Juicy Lucy's. 5-8 or Nook........ You're up next."
1,1,Don't let the hype fool you. The Juicy Lucy at Matt's is a flavorless puck served with hard bar fries. You can easily find a better option.
1,1,"Do not waste your time as this joint (dive bar) has not a single redeeming quality. Lets cut to the chase - the over-hyped and famous ""jucy lucy"" is just two patties, way-overcooked with some very runny cheese (I thought real cheese was thicker). The burger flavor could be replicated almost anywhere else. Oh, at a cost of $7.50!! And, the bar was not very clean either. I felt like a sucker.

Now, when combined with limited street parking, no silverware (not even plastic, right?), the cheapest quality napkins made, no fruit (no orange slice for your beer) and finally, you had to wait at the bar for the bartender to pay your tab. Well, the whole experience was disgusting and not to be repeated."
1,1,New ownership. Was on bizarre foods. Ate there two weeks ago after going for over 40 years. Had warm draft beer. Cold fries. A hockey puck on a hard cold bun. Heart broken. Won't go back. At first just thinking they were having a bad day then I saw it changed owners and that explains the disappointment.
1,1,"Overrated! My sister insists on taking our out of town guests here to sample a true Minnesotan experience because of Matt's claim to fame as inventor of the Jucy Lucy. But that's where the novelty ends. 

Yes, please take your guests here if you want the experience of a long ass wait for dive bar with a single rude waitress giving constant side eye for mediocre grease bomb burgers and floppy fries. The wait probably wouldn't be so long if they had a normal kitchen rather than a single burger flipper behind the bar making all the burgers on a small griddle.

Seriously go elsewhere, there are so many other choices for a delicious Jucy Lucy in the cities! Blue door, the nook, and Shamrocks for example."
1,1,"I really wanted to like this place but will not be back.  Liked the idea of the burgers but unfortunately the meat is so overcooked it's practically petrified- I guess in order to melt the cheese sufficiently.  Beer selection is underwhelming.  All of that would be totally acceptable (almost preferable!) for a dive bar, but what I cannot overlook is how rude the staff is.  There is no need for those bad vibes when there is already so much negativity in the world right now... and there are so many better bars in the Twin Cities."
1,1,"I only reviewed a restaurant one other time and it was because it was so good. I am writing this review on Matts because it was so bad. We have been to Matts many times. We have always thought they made the very best hamburger. We put them on top of ""the best hamburger"" spots in Minneapolis/St Paul. We went to Matts for a late lunch last Monday. My husband and I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. I could not believe how horrible the cheeseburger looked. The patty was a 1/4"" thick and the size of a silver dollar. My husband says his was a little larger diameter. They were both dry and overcooked. The bun was just a bun.  The cheese was a small square of thin cheese. Needless to say, you got a lot of bread and very little meat and cheese. So disappointing. 

The fries were ok. My husband likes them better than me because he likes crunchy, small French fries. 

In Matts defense, I think in the past I have ordered the Juicy Lucy or Double Cheeseburger. Perhaps they are just so much better than the plain cheeseburger. But if so, warn your customer. I won't go back. I'll go to the other ""best hamburger"" spots"
1,1,Waited at the front to be seated like any place. Was helped immediately and directed to a booth seat. We witnessed four other groups come in and be seated while we waited. Twenty minutes passed and in that time we saw all four of those tables be able to place their orders. We must have been forgotten about because not once did anyone come ask us if we've been helped or would like to get started with beverages. As we were about to leave the waitress finally came over for our order. Only stayed because of the reputation of the juicy lucy. My husband and I ordered juicy lucy burgers and our daughter ordered a cheeseburger. Our juicy Lucy burgers were good but halfway through my daughter eating her burger we noticed her's was not cooked thoroughly. Waitress discounted our bill and asked if we wanted a burger to go and we rejected. Just really upset our visit ended like this being we only heard so much great reviews about it.
1,1,"Had the Jucy Lucy. Was in no way juicy. If you're looking for a burger that had been overcooked to the point that  you have to follow every bite with a swig of H2O, this is the place for you. Seriously, I've never had a worse burger.

The fries were okay though.

Be prepared to wait forever for the lump of coal to arrive - 24 minutes was the total time for mine. That could've been cut in half had the grillmeister not insisted on evaporating every molecule of moisture in the burger."
1,1,"I guess if you have a hankering for 60's style burgers, this is your place. It's not worth the wait, the price or the exceptionally rude waitress. The burger was black on the edges, grey on the inside with a burst of hot cheese that makes it palatable at first but gets monotonous 
very quickly. My Coke was warm and they don't have ice - don't bother asking since the waitress will belittle you for asking. She practically bit the head off my husband when he asked if they had water. She then asked, ""Why would you ask if we have water? This is a restaurant and like any other restaurant we have water?""  His reply, ""Maybe a restaurant that doesn't have ice might not have water!""  If you want an exceptional burger, there are far better places that are clean and have a wait staff that treats you like a customer, not a nuisance. Victory 44 is one of them."
1,1,"Everything sucked about this place. Food was bad, especially Jucy Lucy. Crappy selection of beers and wine is terrible. It seemed dirty in there . Don't go there if you have any class! Way overhyped,it deserves 3 stars maximum. Their French freeze is frozen and burgers too with shitty cheese"
1,1,"This place sucks.   Low energy, low quality crap food.  You have to be a drunk to think this is good.   This place is at least 50 years old and they have not improved anything.    I love vintage, nostalgia, home cooking etc, but the food is very low quality $7.25 for a juicy Lucy.  Almost double the price of in n out burger for a much fresher, quality product. 

When a place has 849 reviews you expect something delicious.    Not!! 

The place was dead.  It has one piece of American cheese in this over cooked disaster.   

I really enjoyed the small open kitchen but jeez this place sucks.  

If your a foodie this is a waste of money time and energy.   If your a drunk trying to sober up eat this.  

I feel sorry for people that think this is good.  Try Tommys Malt Shop for a place that makes really good,tasty, high quality food.  I'm just passing through town.  I would Never recommend this place.   Rough area as well w people drinking alcohol on the street."
1,1,"Trip #1:
No flavor even with the amount of cheese inside. I've heard from others through discussion that it's a so called ""hockey puck"". If you order it with onions, you'll simply be receiving a gourmet or glorified White Castle version of a juicy. I think they're relying on the age of the flat top to cook flavoring into their juicy's, but it's not working...

Trip #2:
I dubbed my second trip, Second Chance Saturday (it was of course a Saturday) and thankfully, it's cheap to eat here! Awards all over the place from MSP Mag for best burger and best juicy lucy and I just have one question.... How? Who ever is voting for this place for these awards needs to spend some time exploring more than just 1 place, because it was still nothing to brag about! People wait in a line out the door for these and I could think of plenty of other places I would rather eat at over this place.

Trip #3:
Refuse to attempt trip #3, it's disgusting food!

1,1,"Juicy Lucy's are undercooked in the middle.
Most important....They don't have an Ice Maker???
Your drinks are served warm???
Who wants warm water or warm pop?
Always packed so there's no where to sit.
Food takes forever to get to you and then you end up standing."
